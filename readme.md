# Atlas for State Congresses of the USA

Currently to make a geojson of a given state and house do:
  - Go into distgeojson.js
  - Change the gostate and gohouse variable to whatever you want the thing to go get.
  - Run distgeojson.js

Number one todo is to organize this jam!!

As of now there is a little thing to grab a bunch of the data from the Sunlight foundation and make up a valid geojson file for a given state and house using:
distgeojson.js

which uses sun2geojson.js to create each feature.

then it will put it all together and give me a border.json thing.
